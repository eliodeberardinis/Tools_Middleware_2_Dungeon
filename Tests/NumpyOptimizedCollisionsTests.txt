Execution time results for the experiments run to test the performance of the simple AABB collision system versus the optimized version that uses the numpy library.
All tests use the seed 0.

N. Iterations	Difficulty	Simple AABB	Numpy Optimized		Execution time reduction
3		3		0.443 s		0.432 s			2.48%
3		5		4.289 s		2.047 s			52.27%
5		5		7.123 s		3.233 s			54.61%
7		5		8.919 s		4.436 s			50.26%
10		5		21.575 s	5.83 s			72.98%

All experiments have been also successfully tested to produce the same exact outputs.
