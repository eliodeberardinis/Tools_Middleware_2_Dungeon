Execution time results for the experiments run to test the performance of the simple AABB collision system.
All tests use the seed 0.

N. Iterations	Difficulty	Complex Collisions	AABB Optimized Collisions	Execution time reduction
3				1			1.763 s				0.105 s						94.04%
3				2			3.8 s				0.144 s						96.21%
3				3			20.22 s				0.443 s						97.81%
3				4			197.796 s			1.689 s						99.15%
3				5			629.795 s			4.267 s						99.32%

All experiments have been also successfully tested to produce the same exact outputs.
